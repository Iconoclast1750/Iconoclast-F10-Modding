# Iconoclast-F10-Modding
These folders contain edited FE10Data.cms files which buff enemy generics by a few stats, as well as increasing the caps on the enemy tier 2.5 classes. To use, with a PAL Radiant Dawn ISO, extract the full disc using Dolphin, replace FE10Data.cms in DATA/files and then do whatever randomizing you were going to do and rebuild the ISO with WiiBaFu.

These are intended to be compatible with LordMewtwo's FE10 Randomizer, and were made because it does not have an option to increase enemy generic base stats and also because I want stronger enemies but hate what Hard mode does to EXP gain (Dawn Brigade liker here).

Fixed enemy boosts increases enemy stats as follows:

Tier 1: 1 to all except Speed

Tier 2: 3 to HP, 1 to all others

Tier 2.5 and Spirits: 3 HP, 2 Str/Mag/Lck, 1 to all others

Laguz: 2 HP/Lck, 1 Str/Skl

Fixed enemy boosts is suitable to playthroughs where enemy classes are randomized. It may not be suitable for swapping enemy Beorc and Laguz.

Enemy Boosts By Class increases them as follows:
Each class line has been assigned 2 Best stats, 2 High, 2 Low and 2 Worst stats, with the intention of emphasizing their strengths while keeping their weaknesses.

This was done partially based on growths and caps, and occasionally based on vibes. Sword/Axe Cavalry have different boosts from Lance/Bow Cavalry.

Generics with a given class will have increased stats as follows:

Tier 1: +2 to Best stats, +1 to High and Low, +0 to Worst

Tier 2: +2 to Best and High stats, +1 to Low, +0 to Worst

Tier 2.5: +3 to Best, +2 to High stats, +1 to Low, +0 to Worst

*Armored units actually received 0 in 3 stats (Mag, Spd, Res).

Laguz gained roughly 6 points worth of stats, where 2 HP counts as 1 point.

Enemy Boosts By Class is suitable to playthroughs where enemy classes are not randomized.

These aren't large boosts, and users are encouraged to also increase enemy growths via LordMewtwo's randomizer if they want. 

Tier 2.5 class caps are increased to match the appropriate Tier 3 class; they will now cap at comparable stat lines to your units.
